[简体中文](./README-zh.md)

## Introduction

A simple, lightweight, high-speed intranet (large) file transfer assistant

## Why

- Cross-platform file transfer is troublesome and slow, especially for large files

- Transferring files through the external network is unsafe and slow

## Idea

Use the current device as a resource server to achieve resource interoperability

## Usage

1. Make sure all devices are in the same LAN

2. Install the client and run it. Other devices can open the resource server URL through the browser to achieve file transfer

## Todo

- [ ] Internationalization
- [ ] UI optimization
